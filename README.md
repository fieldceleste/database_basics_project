# _Volunteer Tracker_
## _By: Celeste Field_
## Description

_This application will allow a user to be able to track current non-profit projects and allow the user to see who is currently working on them. Each volunteer only belongs to one project, but the project could have different volunteers working on the same project. This page will use routing with Ruby, as well as an SQL database to store the projects and volunteers information._
